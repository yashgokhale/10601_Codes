# 10601_Codes
These are the codes generated for the Machine Learning Class at CMU for Spring 2020. 
The entire code is done through numpy library and does not use scikitlearn/keras/pytorch anywhere. All models are built from scratch.
Following are the codes used:
1. Decision Stump Algorithm: decisionstump.py
2. Decision Tree Algorithm: inspection.py for calculating Gini Gain and decisiontree.py for actual decision tree regression with binary attributes
3. Logistic Regression: feature.py for generating a sparse matrix for logistic regression and lr.py for the actual logistic regression
4. Neural Network: neuralnet.py used with stochastic gradient descent 
5. Hidden Markov Model for Part of Speech Tagging: learnhmm.py to calculate the parameters for the model and forwardbackward.py to actually predict the part of speech tagging
6. Reinforcement Learning: Solving the MountainCar problem giving by OpenAI with q learning using linear function approximation.
